 Alright, alright, alright. We're back. This is the overview lecture for module three. The first of two groups of modules on grand strategy. Grand strategy is the set of overarching ideas that guide the conduct of U.S. Foreign Policy. Grand strategy identifies a set of interests that the United States should pursue and the appropriate policy means to achieve these goals. These ideas are often bundled together into a brand or a narrative like isolationism or containment. They also help to identify competing positions of foreign policy debate in the United States. Consequently, these grand strategy ideas provide a conceptual tool kit by which to evaluate the foreign policies being implemented by the American government and alternatives proposed by other politicians that are active in broad public policy debates like presidential candidates. There will be three lecture segments in topic three. The first identifies this concept of a grand strategy. The second identifies some of the components of a grand strategy. The third lecture segment in this section defines the first example of a grand strategy position that has shaped American foreign policy. That of isolationism. After identifying the key components of isolationism we work through some historical examples of it including George Washington's farewell address and U.S. foreign policy between the World Wars. Finally note that the lecture segments will contain some contemporary references to the internal debate inside the United States over how to confront ISIS. Many Republicans in Congress, including John McCain and Lindsey Graham support a tougher response to ISIS than implemented by the President including the insertion of more American ground troops in Iraq. We hope you enjoy this module.
