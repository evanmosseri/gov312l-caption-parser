 We're gonna move on to hegemonic, the security element of hegemonic stability theory. And there is this security variant which holds that a hegemon can encourage other countries to oppose emerging threats to the international security environment. And these efforts to construct and lead multi-national coalitions help to deter and limit the severity of military and political challenges to the broader international status quo. So these ideas are nested historically in the post World War I experience. The United States, in that period withdrew militarily from Europe, which ultimately creates a security vacuum that was filled by Nazi Germany. Part of the concern here stems from delayed reaction by European countries, particularly Great Britain and France, to Hitler's rise. Even though both Great Britain and France recognize Hitler as a threat, there was an element of free riding, a hope that other countries would lead the effort and shoulder more of the burden of resisting Hitler in the 1930s. The experience that culminates in World War II plays a large role in the American decision to stay engaged in Europe after 1945. The United States led the enforcement of the post-war settlement on Germany, and also played the central role in containing the spread of Soviet influence influence in Europe. You could also argue that current American efforts to contain and destroy ISIS in the contemporary period are another manifestation of this vital leadership. Along these lines, the American commitment to confront ISIS and support new Iraqi regime helped foster the construction of an international coalition that would share the cost of defeating ISIS. Finally, let me just lay out some of the broader implications of this discussion for contemporary American foreign policy. They suggest that the United States has an important leadership role to play in international politics, if the United States does not lead the efforts in say confronting ISIS, or stabilizing the global economy or cutting greenhouse gas emissions, these public goods supported by many countries and will benefit many countries simply will be under supplied. If the United States doesn't do it, potentially no one else will. This theory, this hegemonic stability theory, helps to provide some foundation for thinking about the United States as this indispensable nation. If the US doesn't lead, then important international public goods may not be supplied. We can see this in the context of interwar Europe, between World War I and World War II. At the same time though, it raises an important question. What happens when American capacities, our abilities, or our will, our desire to lead, decline? Will these challenges be met by a group of nations? Or will they simply be unmet, and unanswered? So this leads to the next crucial concept. Power transition theory. The question about what happens to the larger international order when the dominant states lose -- or a dominant state loses its advantage hangs in the background of a larger ongoing conversation on contemporary relations between China, a rising power, and the United States, current hegemon. Over the past 20 years or so, as the success of China's period of economic reform has grown. A larger debate has ensued about how China's development will shape the larger international order and the position of the United States within that order. Power transition theory, which is related to, as a cousin, say, of hegemonic stability theory, holds that this larger structure is determined by the rise and fall of leading powers. The ascendancy and maintenance of a leading state's position is associated with economic growth and peace more broadly in the system. And here you can think about our discussion in the prior lecture on great power politics when we discussed how uni-polarity is associated with great power peace. Alternatively, the decline of the leading power, often prompted by a new set of challenges emanating from a rising state, is associated with instability and war. So a rising power, more stability, a declining leading power, more instability in war. These theoretical claims are nested in the logic of the commitment problem which we discussed before. Because a rising state can not commit to restrain its future attempts to revise the larger international status quo. A declining state might decide to launch a war to prevent the emergence of the new hegemon. Remember, this is a problem associated with contracting over time, and you can think about it in these terms. Let's just imagine that the United States is twice as powerful as China in 2015. This distribution of military power shapes the balance of political influence in East Asia, the Middle East, the global economy and elsewhere. The U.S. enjoys more influence in all of these domains right now. Right? Both governments, however, believe that China will grow stronger over time, because of its economy and the like. Imagine that the distribution of military power between the two countries will be equal in the future in say 2030. This military equality will give China more influence in East Asia and other parts of the world. This growth in Chinese political influence will come at a cost to America's political influence. The United States will have to make concessions in 2030 if it's relatively weaker and, equal to China as opposed to being, much, larger and stronger. A solution to the problem of war in 2020s say if the United States desires to pre-empt this. It might simply be a Chinese commitment in 2020 not to demand more political influence in the Middle East in 2030, right? To just provide that kind of concession stance. The logic of the commitment problem holds that China cannot credibly promise in 2020 to restrain itself in 2030. Now, why? There might be new leaders in power, but more importantly interests tend to expand with strength. When China realizes what the United States did in 1945, namely that it used its military strength to secure new political concessions, power transition theory holds that it will go ahead and make those same kinds of demands, those new demands in 2030. Its new found strength in 2030 will allow it to successfully make such demands, in the future. This theoretical possibility stands behinds many of the concerns about the future of the U.S- Chinese relationship. In these debates, because wealth is such a key input to military power 35 years of sustained economic growth in China, at much faster rates than in the United States, suggests that we might just be entering into such a destabilizing period of transition. So. >> Can I jump in here? >> Yes, please. >> So power transition theory. Here's the key. We, we, Rob just gave you three time points 2015, 2020, 2030. U.S. much higher in 2015, declining over 2030. Power transition theory holds that the United States might go to war in 2020 to avoid having to make concessions in 2030. How do you solve this problem? One potential way is for Chinese leaders to commit, in 2020, not to make new demands in 2030, but they can't, because it's so hard to commit in 2020, not to take advantage, of the gains that youÂ’re going to have 10 years later because you could have new leaders, in power or the strength, gives you more capacity to make these concessions. This is the same thing that's going on in the Middle East today. What the collapse of the, of Saddam's regime in Iraq did, was strengthen Iran, so we're in the midst of a power transition. Iran is, its regional influence is growing. And this is, making Saudi Arabia, and the United State nervous. And so we now have this proxy war in Yemen -- in Yemen, which is about and, and the concern on the horizon is how do we contain the growth of Iran's influence? One of the -- the United States thinks one of the ways to get a deal here to control Iran's growing influence, is the nuclear program. Right? And the Obama Administration views an Iranian nuclear deal as an alternative to what power transition theory would expect, which would be a fight, to prevent the breakout of a new a Hegemon. And this is one of the concerns if this deal breaks down, then we might not get a longer term peaceful solution to the problem of war in the Middle East. >> Because the logic of a strike on Iran right now by say, Israel, is hit them now before they get the nuclear weapon. >> Exactly. >> And that's just preemptive strike of >> Exactly. >> Stability. >> Hit them now before they get strong enough, where we can't bargain with them in the future. >> Right.
