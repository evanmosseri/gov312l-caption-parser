 ï»¿1 Welcome back. The content for this module concentrates on how American participation in international organizations like the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, structures international politics. It is comprised of six segments. The first defines institutions and organizations, and differentiates international institutions, like sovereignty, from international organizations like the UN. The second provides multiple answers to an important question, how do international institutions and international organizations influence international politics? I want you to take at least one important theme out of this segment. International organizations do not need the capacity to enforce the rules that they create, or support, to matter in international politics. They help to define what is appropriate in international politics. They provide important information to states, and they help to allocate political power among states. The third segment uses a clip from 'The Daily Show' to reinforce this theme that international organizations possess power and influence that is independent of their often limited capacity to enforce their own directives. The discussion sets up a conversation about the relationship between the United States and the United Nations. The fourth segment discusses the role of the United States in the most prominent multi-lateral military organization since World War II, namely NATO. The fifth segment explores the transformation of NATO after the Cold War, and the sixth segment relies on the Stewart Reading that was assigned for this module, to think about how global governance through international organizations is changing.
