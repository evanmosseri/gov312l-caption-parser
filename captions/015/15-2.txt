 Deterrence is a psychological process built around issuing credible threats of punishment to convince an adversary to refrain from acting in a certain way. Now, I provide a definition of deterrence on your slide, and it comes from Joseph Nye. He states that deterrence is -- the act of deterrence is to discourage attack through the threat of retaliation. And so, "If you attack me, I may not be able to prevent your attack," "but I can retaliate so powerfully that you will not want to attack" "in the first place." This is deterrence. And so deterrence must be distinguished from defense, which is an action that prevents an adversary from taking a certain action. We experience deterrence all the time in our daily lives. And so, deterrence is actually something you have come into contact with. For example, the kinds of threats I make as a parent to my college-age sons here at UT. To get them to try hard and try to get good grades in their classes, is a form of deterrence. I cannot really defend against bad grades by them, since I don't sit with them in class, and I don't do their homework for them, or with them, right? Instead, all I have is deterrence, and so, I threaten them. I threaten them with high costs if they don't get good grades. Right now, my sons get to live on campus and enjoy all the charms of life as a UT student, but if they do not get good grades, they'll have to move back home to Round Rock and live with me, and my wife and their younger brother again. Now, luckily for all of us, it has not come to that. This is deterrence. I will retaliate against you, Sam and Jake, and you will have to go back to your Camaro bedroom in Round Rock, Texas. Sam. Now, of course, this example of deterrence showcases one of the major problems with deterrence. Do I really want my sons to live at home again now that I've gotten them out of the house? The answer is not just no, it is hell no. So, is my deterrent threat credible? I think we all know the answer to that. >> Paper tiger. >> I am a paper tiger. So, that is deterrence. Now, once we establish what deterrence is and how nuclear weapons are used, then we get to the next big concept that is a center piece of Cold War nuclear deterrence strategy, and that is mutually assured destruction, and before we get into mutually assured destruction, we are going, again, back to the 80's -- the best decade ever -- and we're going to show this clip from a movie that I was very familiar with when I was working in a movie theater, War Games. I saw the end about a hundred times. Every time I let the folks out. So, let's roll the clip from War Games. >> It hasn't learned. Is there any way to make it play itself? >> Yes, number of players, zero. >> Seven. >> Come on. Learn god damn it! >> Eight. >> Let's get [inaudible]. It's drawing more and more power from the rest of the system. >> Nine numbers. Ten! It's got the code, it's going to launch! [scream] >> [Inaudible] call the [inaudible] get me a long status report. >> [Inaudible] get me the president. >> Yes, sir. >> How you doing, Colonel? >> Sir, our landlines out of the mountain are dead. I'm trying to break through on satellites. >> What's it doing? >> It's learning. >> Greetings, Professor Falken. >> Hello, Joshua. >> A strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess? [cheering] >> Okay. >> So, just a little background that Rob didn't give before -- he was so excited about this clip-- >> I thought everyone saw this movie. >> The movie was before they were born. >> Go to Turner Movie Classics man, and watch this. >> So what happens in War Games is this rogue computer takes over all the nuclear launch codes, and then it looks like it's going to launch a nuclear war on its own, and the point is that the computer learns that fighting a nuclear war is completely irrational. >> Because once you start, it always ends the same way, everybody gets destroyed. Like tic-tac-toe, unless, you know, you're really good at tic-tac-toe like me. >> Unless you're playing against your five-year-old son. >> I sometimes win tic-tac-toe because I out-maneuver... [laughs] But, the point is that -- and this is why it's a good -- you know, a good depiction of mutually assured destruction. The logic of mutually assured destruction, as we'll get into in just a second, is that once you get a system in which both sides in conflict have nuclear weapons, and have, what we're going to call -- we're going to explain -- second strike capability, neither side has any incentive to start a nuclear war because they too will be destroyed. It always end the same way, and so, it's a strange game. "The only winning move is not to play." I couldn't keep the voice going so... Anyway, as mentioned earlier then, nuclear weapons are different because they are so destructive. And as Pat noted in his introduction, Carl von Clausewitz, a German military philosopher, came up with the idea and the concept of total war to conceptualize a war so terrible and destructive that it no longer served the purpose of war, which is to protect and enhance the state. And so you've got a quote here from Gaddis, who is channeling Clausewitz. She says, "States would become the victims of war" "if weapons ever became so destructive that they placed at risk the purposes" "for which wars were being fought." In that circumstance, "any resort to force, under such circumstances," "could destroy what it was meant to defend." And Churchill had -- Winston Churchill, prime minister of Great Britain during World War II -- had a similar take on nuclear weapons. He said, "The new terror brings a certain element of equality" "in annihilation. Strange as it may seem, it is to the universality" "of potential destruction that I think we may look with hope and even confidence." Now, what is Churchill getting at here? The key to MAD, mutually assured destruction, is that each side has what is called a second strike capability. And a second strike capability is simply the ability to survive an attack from the other side, the first strike, and then retaliate with a second strike that will destroy the attacker, right? The country that initiated the conflict. Right? What is interesting and counterintuitive about the concept of total war, and nuclear weapons, is that because a nuclear war was so terrible and destructive, total war rather than limited war, no one could win, and fighting it served no purpose. In the context of mutually assured destruction, when both sides have the capability of weathering attack, and then retaliating by annihilating the other side, and destroying human civilization itself, then neither side had an incentive to start a war. In this way, war itself, at least direct contact between the two super powers, is irrational and should be avoided all-together because it could escalate into something that would destroy all of civilization. In fact, the strategy of massive retaliation, that was developed by president Dwight D. Eisenhower, was built around just this type of logic. President Eisenhower established a deterrent strategy that threatened, or at least was vague about nuclear retaliation for all sorts of conflicts. Even regional ones. And the logic was this: if any war could escalate to nuclear war, then all war would have to be avoided. And so, I think we can take a break and take at least a question or two. >> Sure. >> Let's take this question about -- there's a question -- can you clarify the difference between defense and deterrence? >> I'm going to stand up for a second. >> You're going to stand up? >> I'm going to stand up, can you guys move the camera? So, imagine now Rob tries to stand up -- try to stand up. >> Try to stand up? >> Right, so this is defense. I'm physically preventing him -- well, now -- after I stopped physically preventing him -- You're shorter than me. >> Well. >> So defense is physically preventing someone from doing something that you don't want them to do. >> Okay. >> So, deterrence is, I say to Rob, "If you stand up, I'm going to" "hit you in the face." >> Or how about, "If you stand up, I'm going to fire you," "as chair of the department." [laughs] >> So, right, use of credible threats. >> That's a very non-credible threat. >> Yeah. So both of these were non-credible. One, I have tenure, and the other one, if I hit him in the face I go to jail. So, neither one -- >> Oh is that what you're afraid of? >> Yeah. [laughs] >> Anyway. >> But so that's the difference. Think about defense as physically -- both of these strategies are designed to protect civilian populations. Defense is using physical force, or your military, from preventing your adversary from imposing harm on your civilian population. Deterrence is about using threats. Promising to impose unacceptable costs on an adversary if they do something that you don't want them to do. >> Right.
