 ï»¿1 This module is the first of two on the challenges posed by the threat of terrorism. The next module will continue this conversation by examining the counter-terror policies of the United States that have been implemented after 9/11. This module is comprised of five segments. The first casts 9/11 as a watershed event in American history and discusses how it changed the domestic and foreign policy environment in the United States. The second segment defines terrorism. The third segment continues this discussion of terrorism by describing how terrorists pose a different type of national security threat to the United States than those emanating from states, like Russia or Iran. The fourth segment also asks an important question that you have probably encountered before: Are terrorists rational actors? We treat rationality here as instrumental or goal-oriented behavior that is designed to achieve some political end. There is an important caveat to this characterization. It does not include any normative or value-based evaluation of the goals that terrorists might be pursuing. In other words, even if the goals of terrorists are horrific, like the elimination of people with a specific set of religious beliefs, terrorists can still be rational in the technical sense if their behavior is oriented around achieving some political goal. This discussion of rationality is important because it implies that the actions of terrorists could be understood and effectively countered through policy tools possessed by the United States. In particular, the assumption of rationality on the part of terrorists infers that their behavior could be altered, because they might be sensitive to some set of political, economic, or military costs. The fifth segment reviews the Hoffman reading that was assigned for this module.
