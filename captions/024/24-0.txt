 ï»¿1 In this module we will discuss the politics of oil. Oil is perhaps the most important commodity, both politically and economically, that is traded in the global economy. Huge swings in its price redistribute wealth among nations, meaning wars have been fought over access to it and American foreign policy in the Middle East has long been guided by the need to protect important allies in the region like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait so they can insure stability in oil markets through their sizable exports. This module will discuss the international politics of oil to help you understand why the Middle East plays such a central role in US foreign policy. It proceeds in six segments. The first begins to establish the economic importance of oil in the global economy. The second describes some of the attributes of the global oil market. The third talks briefly about the consequences of the shale revolution in the United States for the global oil market. The fourth segment discusses the politics of the organization of petroleum-exporting countries, or OPEC. The fifth segment builds on these segments to talk more broadly about the geopolitics of oil. It examines how American national interest in the Middle East and political influence relative to major oil producers might be changing as a result of the shale revolution. Finally the sixth segment discusses the Levy reading assigned for this module which looks at the role of China and the rest of Asia in the global energy market.
