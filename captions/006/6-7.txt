 This particular foreign policy event is the American response to the use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Assad in 2013. And as your readings and pre-class module make clear the role of Congress in US foreign policy is complicated by partisan and institutional struggles for power with the President, as well as political and electoral considerations over how Congressional votes and other interventions in foreign policy may affect individual members of Congress in their futures, right? And so, you can see this indeed on dramatic display in the 2016 Presidential contest, as candidates who are members of Congress argue with each other over the wisdom of previous stands on past foreign policy issues that they took while being a member of either the Senate or the House of Representatives. And for example, the vote on authorizing force in the Iraq War has been a real dilemma for Hillary Clinton, as she's ran for President in 2008, it was used by Barack Obama against her, because he was against the war, and she voted for it. And now, Bernie Sanders is doing the same thing. And so, Hillary Clinton I'm sure, would love to have that vote back. Now, the reason I'm bringing this up, is that, these political considerations play out in the dynamic between the President and Congress, and it's well illustrated in this particular response by the United States the use of chemical weapons by Assad in 2013. So first I want to give you some background, by 2012, protests for what became known as "The Arab Spring" in authoritarian regimes throughout the Middle East, that started to take down authoritarian regimes in Tunisia, and Egypt. And these protests spread to Syria. Now President Assad was facing large and angry crowds in the streets that were calling for his resignation. And many believed that he might fall from power just as President Hussein Mubarak did in Egypt. However, President Assad and his government which is based on a very small ethnic minority within the country was much more willing to use force to stay in power. And so, they did. And during the emerging civil war between President Assad, who used excessive and quite a bit of force against what became rebels in Syria, there were reports and speculation that Assad may use his stockpile of chemical weapons against the rebels. Which would be a violation of an international treaty banning the use of chemical weapons, even when a country is at war. So we're gonna pick up this story about the Syrian Civil War, in August of 2012, when President Obama issues his "red line" ultimatum on President Assad and his potential use of chemical weapons against his own citizens. And he does so in a response to a question by a reporter, Chuck Todd, in August of 2012, and so let's go ahead and run two clips from the Frontline, on this particular episode. >> With no one to stop him, Assad initiated a new phase in the war. The deployment of chemical weapons. >> The Assad regime calculated that their use of chemical weapons would strike terror in the hearts of the civilians. And would ultimately rob the rebel forces of the civilian populace in which it needed to operate in. So it was very calculated, it was very shrewd, and it was very, very cynical. >> A few months earlier, the President was holding a routine press conference about campaign finance, Medicare and Afghanistan. Then, came the last question of the day. >> Chuck Todd. >> Update us on your latest thinking of where you think things are in Syria, and in particular, whether you envision using US military, >> In his response, President Obama brought up Assad's prospective use of chemical weapons. >> We have been very clear to the Assad regime that a 'red line' for us, is, we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around, or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation. >> That was not apparently a planned thing, he said it in response to a question from a reporter, who was asking about the use of chemical weapons. >> And that there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing movement on the chemical weapons front. >> Some of the aids, in fact, who heard him say this, were surprised, they didn't know where that phrase had come from. >> Thank you everybody. >> Then, a sarin gas attack on a rebel-held suburb of Damascus. (shouting in foreign language) Sarin is a nerve agent that causes lung muscle paralysis, and results in death from suffocation. (sobbing, talking in foreign language) >> 1400 men, women and children were killed according to what the American intelligence agencies tell the President. At this point, the President can't ignore it, he has to have some sort of response. He has drawn this red line, he may be trapped by it, but he understands that his credibility, and the credibility of the United States are on the line. >> The indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, the killing of women and children and innocent bystanders, by chemical weapons is a moral obscenity. President Obama believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world's most heinous weapons against the world's most vulnerable people. >> The President ordered the military to get ready. >> So a couple of points here. First, the 'red line' ultimatum was an unscripted response to a reporter's question, rather than a prepared statement that was debated and crafted by President Obama and his National Security team. As the clip states, the language about a 'red line', and the threat to use force in response to the use of chemical weapons by Assad took President Obama's advisors by surprise. But it should be noted that the Obama Administration did not walk back from the threat in the days and weeks following the statement. It would be a full year before these words would prompt the US into action. It was Assad's use of Sarin gas outside of Damascus in August of 2013 that would really bring the 'red line' comment from 2012 back into relevance. This attack was not the first reported use of chemical weapons by Assad. The Obama Administration had claimed that Assad used chemical weapons in June of 2013 as well, and this prompted calls for military activities, including sending arms to Syrian rebels, but that was held up by Congress, which was worried about vetting the rebels receiving military aid. The larger scale attack in August that resulted in 1400 casualties in videos of the carnage shown on YouTube, increased pressure on the Obama Administration to respond based on his earlier statement from 2012, that any use of chemical weapons would be met by a US military response. Within days, President Obama commanded the military to draw up plans for a military strike against Syria, and Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated the threat that the US will strike militarily in response to Assad's use of chemical weapons. So, oh, sorry, go ahead. >> So, after this initial escalation toward military intervention, the crisis sort of hits a second phase, when President Obama, in, as you'll see it from the clip, an apparent sort of change of heart, requests Congressional authorization for the use of force to get Congressional buy-in, and perhaps avoid taking this action all alone. And now we have this clip, again from Frontline, that chronicles this development, and so let's run that clip now. >> But, Obama's having second thoughts. He's feeling alone. His friends in Britain say, "Yes, we're with you," but then Parliament says, "No, we're not." >> It is clear to me that the British Parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action. I get that, and the government will act accordingly. >> It was a Friday night, I got a call from the President of the United States, and he said to me, "I am considering an alternative course of action," and he wanted me overnight to consider whether a delay would in any way affect our ability to be effective with our military options. >> The next morning, Obama summoned his long-time foreign policy advisor, now Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough. >> And he goes for a walk on the South lawn with McDonough, and they circle this pathway again and again and again, for 45 minutes, talking about what to do. And the President tells him, "I've got this idea. "Why don't we go to Congress "and ask them to approve a strike?" What he's looking for is buy-in. >> As near as we can tell, he worried that he didn't have sufficient political support for, you know, what might be a long running conflict. >> The President was looking for a way to not have to make good on the threat that he had made. I think because the President, having drawn that red line, realized that he had no appetite for direct military engagement in Syria. >> So he comes back in from this walk with Denis McDonough, and he tells some of his other advisors, and they can't believe what they're hearing. This is a crazy idea as far as they're concerned. If you go to Congress, they tell him, and you lose a vote like this, it would be devastating to your political standing. And they pushed back. And he held firm. >> A few hours later, the President called a press conference in the rose garden. >> Now after careful deliberation, I have decided that the United States should take military action against Syrian regime targets. But, having made my decision as Commander in Chief, based on what I am convinced is our national security interests. I will seek authorization for the use of force from the American people's representatives in Congress. >> At the time, he was describing it as seeking strong political support for this decisive move, he had all the rhetoric of action, but in truth, it was stepping back from the imminent attack that was ahead. And it was all in motion, and at the last minute, the President blinked. >> I was there in Southern Turkey at the time, and I can tell you that the Syrian people were looking at the skies hoping that the United States Airforce would come to the rescue. And then all of a sudden, on September 1st, the Syrian people woke up and realized that the United States was not going to come to their rescue. 1000 >> Not only did the Syrians believed this, 1001 the French Armed Forces were mobilizing, 1002 they were ready to go ahead, 1003 and they stopped at the last minute 1004 when they heard that the President 1005 is going to ask for Congressional authorization. 1006 >> And this is, in some ways, 1007 the riskiest decision, 1008 certainly in foreign policy, 1009 that he's made of his presidency. 1010 And he's put his credibility in the hands 1011 of a Congress that doesn't like him. 1012 >> Alright, 1013 so as the clip suggests, 1014 President Obama, in the second phase, 1015 has second thoughts about going it alone 1016 in the use of force, 1017 first after the British House of Commons 1018 surprisingly refuses to support military intervention 1019 in Syria, 1020 and you've got to realize 1021 that Great Britain has been a reliable ally 1022 in the use of force in the Middle East 1023 along with the United States, 1024 for decades now, 1025 ever since the first Gulf War. 1026 And arguably, 1027 this suggests that 1028 there would be rather weak international support 1029 for American intervention if Great Britain isn't on board. 1030 And also, there's hints in that vote 1031 in the House of Commons 1032 that mass publics, 1033 including the electorate in the United States, 1034 may not support another war in the Middle East. 1035 So, 1036 as the, you know, 1037 the name of this broadcast on Frontline 1038 is "The President Blinked", 1039 you know, he's starting to have second thoughts. 1040 And in order to avoid, then, 1041 being politically isolated on this issue 1042 and having to take all the responsibility 1043 for initiating military action in Syria, 1044 Obama decides to go to Congress for authorization. 1045 And this accomplishes two things for him. 1046 According to the observers shown in the clip. 1047 First, it slows down the process 1048 and leaves an opening 1049 to avoid military intervention altogether. 1050 And second, 1051 if military action does go forward, 1052 after Congress authorizes force, 1053 the President 1054 will have that Congressional support, 1055 and more importantly, 1056 he can share with Congress the responsibility 1057 for the intervention. 1058 Of course, the danger here, 1059 as noted in the clip, 1060 is that Congress could vote President Obama down 1061 on the authorization to use force, 1062 and this would be a huge blow 1063 to his international and domestic status and power. 1064 So, 1065 the question is whether this action, 1066 was this an action of a President 1067 that was firm in his belief to go to war, 1068 over the use of chemical weapons 1069 and he was just looking for Congressional buy-in 1070 to bolster the legitimacy of this action? 1071 Or, was it the action of a President 1072 that was reticent and reluctant to use force, 1073 and looking for a way out 1074 of following through 1075 on that threat that he had initiated 1076 in 2012, 1077 and was hoping that, perhaps, 1078 Congress would say "No!" 1079 just as the House of Commons said no 1080 to it's Prime Minister, Davey Cameron. 1081 What ever the case, 1082 the debate in Congress 1083 did signal that the President 1084 didn't really have the votes necessary 1085 for a positive authorization 1086 to use force, 1087 particularly in the House of Representatives. 1088 So, as you'll see, 1089 even though the vote didn't actually come to pass 1090 because of further developments, 1091 the signal was that he was gonna lose. 1092 And so, 1093 >> So note again 1094 how external developments, 1095 a debate, 1096 a vote in the House of Commons, 1097 shapes what's going on in the United States. 1098 This decision in the United States 1099 was not made in isolation, 1100 and based on consultations 1101 between just the President and Congress, 1102 it's external events, 1103 what's going on in Great Britain, 1104 an important ally that also steered this debate 1105 and the decisions that follow from it. 1106 So finally, the crisis takes another unexpected turn 1107 and enters a third phase, 1108 in which Secretary of State, first, 1109 John Kerry, seems to inadvertently give Syria 1110 a way to avoid air strikes, 1111 and then Russia intervenes to diffuse the crisis. 1112 So we've got a final clip from Frontline 1113 that chronicles this turn of events, 1114 and so let's go ahead and run that clip now. 1115 >> Suddenly comes up, 1116 this bolt from the blue effect, 1117 a Russian proposal to avoid a strike 1118 by getting Syria to agree to give up 1119 it's chemical weapons 1120 >> Mr. Secretary, 1121 in that CBS interview that you just referenced, 1122 Bashar al-Assad said that 1123 not socially >> It began when 1124 a reporter in London in asked Secretary Kerry 1125 how Assad could possibly avoid a strike. 1126 >> He could turn over every single bit 1127 of his chemical weapons to the international community 1128 in the next week, 1129 turn it over, all of it. 1130 Without delay, 1131 and allow a full and total accounting 1132 for that, 1133 but he isn't about to do it, 1134 and it can't be done obviously. 1135 >> It was an offhand remark, 1136 but it got the attention of Russian Foreign Minister, 1137 Sergey Lavrov. 1138 He contacted a Syrian counterpart 1139 who got Assad to agree. 1140 Obama went on network TV 1141 to sell the idea to the American public. 1142 >> This represents a potentially positive development. 1143 We are going to run this to ground. 1144 John Kerry will be talking to his Russian counterpart, 1145 we're gonna make sure that we see 1146 how serious these proposals are. 1147 >> And so at the time, 1148 it seemed like, 1149 a flyer, what on Earth are you doing, 1150 you're gonna really trust 1151 two of the people in the world we trust the least, 1152 Vladimir Putin and Bashar al-Assad, 1153 but in the end, 1154 it worked. 1155 It became a diplomatic way out 1156 of a terrible situation that he had found himself in, 1157 that he put himself in. 1158 >> But what if he had bombed? 1159 What if he had bombed and killed, let's say, 1160 100 soldiers, 1161 and blew up some intelligence centers in Damascus. 1162 What would that have gotten him? 1163 That would have gotten him 1164 in the middle of the war. 1165 He said that he was gonna deal with chemical weapons, 1166 which he did. 1167 And he did it magnificently. 1168 And he, without killing anybody, 1169 he managed to get those chemical weapons 1170 out of Syria. 1171 >> It was the right decision. 1172 Had we conducted the military campaign 1173 that had been planned, 1174 we would not have taken out 1175 a high percentage of his chemical weapons. 1176 The credible threat of force 1177 brought about an opening for diplomacy 1178 to come in, 1179 which then led to something 1180 that no one thought was possible. 1181 >> No, I think it was a terrible, terrible error 1182 on the part of this administration. 1183 I mean, it's not just a red line, 1184 this is the President of the United States. 1185 This is the White House. 1186 And a tinpot dictator 1187 challenges that, 1188 and gets away with it? 1189 Who's gonna believe you next time? 1190 >> Alright, so this phase of the crisis begins 1191 with Secretary of State, Kerry, 1192 issuing another, apparently unscripted comment 1193 that Syria could avoid airstrikes 1194 if it gave up all of it's chemical weapons. 1195 Spokespersons for the Obama Administration 1196 would later clarify that Kerry was speaking 1197 in a hypothetical, 1198 but someone also claimed that the statement 1199 was a flyer to see if it could get a positive response 1200 from Syria, and it's patron Russia. 1201 Almost immediately, 1202 Russia seizes on Kerry's statement, 1203 and gets Assad to agree to this condition 1204 in order to avoid military strikes. 1205 The Obama Administration embraces 1206 the Russian initiative, 1207 even though it expresses doubt 1208 and mistrust of both Russia as a broker of the deal, 1209 and Syria to follow through on the deal. 1210 Nevertheless, President Obama seems to have 1211 a few other options, 1212 seemed to have a few other options since Congress 1213 was unlikely to support his proposal 1214 to use force anyway. 1215 So the Obama Administration accepts the Russian initiative, 1216 and avoids potential negative Congressional vote 1217 on the use of military force. 1218 So Russia and Syria then follow through on the deal, 1219 and Syria gives up it's chemical weapons, 1220 and allows UN inspectors to verify. 1221 Even with this relatively positive ending, 1222 there are contrasting perspectives on it's result. 1223 As your clip showed, 1224 some argued that the process, 1225 despite being messy, 1226 produced a very positive outcome in the end. 1227 President Assad gave up his chemical weapons, 1228 something that military airstrikes 1229 were very unlikely to achieve on their own. 1230 On the other side, 1231 critics argue that the process and outcome 1232 resulted in the US losing credibility, 1233 and some moral authority, 1234 because it did not follow through on it's threat 1235 to use force when it said it would. 1236 Critics argue that this sends a very dangerous signal 1237 to others. 1238 Also, it provided an opening to Russia 1239 to gain international prestige and influence, 1240 soon after it was isolated for invading Ukraine.
