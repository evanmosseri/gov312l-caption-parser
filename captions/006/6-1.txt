 ï»¿1 The place to start when thinking about congressional powers in foreign policy is with the constitution. Congress has given direct constitutional powers over the power to make war and finalize peace treaties in three specific provisions of the constitution. First and foremost, Congress and Congress alone has the power to declare war. As stated in article 1, section 8. Second, congress is expressly tasked with establishing, that is funding, the armed forces. And third, the senate has power to block a president's treaty, if over one-third of it's body objects. So these are the Constitutional powers. Unfortunately for Congress since World War two circumstances to the rise of the US as a global superpower has meant greater interventions without, let me stress that again, without the former, the formal declaration of war. However, just because a formal declaration of war is not of much relevance in today's world, does not mean that the Congress does not play an important role in foreign policy. For example, we have a reading for today by David Kaye called Stealth Multilateralism, that discusses the influence that Congress can have on U.S Foreign Policy through the constitutional provision, that the Senate can block a president's treaty if only one-third of the Senate objects. Since neither political party usually holds that two-thirds super majority in the Senate, that is the requirement to ratify treaties, this means the party that does not, let me stress that again, that does not occupy the presidency can hold hostage any and all treaties that a president wants to establish.
