 Now we're going to fast-forward from the problems within the Cold War. I mean, in the Cold War, within the third world, in places like Vietnam, to the end of the Cold War in the 1980s. Now, let me make a couple of broad comments regarding the end of the Cold War, first, though. While some people may claim they predicted the end, no one really foresaw the timing or the manner of the end of the Cold War. Not only did they not really predict the timing, they didn't foresee how this long standing conflict would end with basically the decline capitulation and ultimately the collapse of one side, the Soviet Union. Most foresaw some sort of military confrontation instead, eventually. So why and how did the Cold War end the way it did? This is still a thriving debate, so I'm going to provide you with two competing explanations. The first one concentrates on the role of the United States. And gives much of the credit for the end of the Cold War, to President Ronald Reagan and his foreign policy. Arguing that Reagan's foreign policy put pressure on the Soviet Union to reform, and that eventually ended the Cold War. The second reverses this caus, this causal logic. It argues that Mikhail Gorbachev and the Soviet Union was chiefly responsible for the way the Cold War ended, because they were the source of all the real meaningful change in the relationship. So. >> So let's briefly look at each of these explanations individually. The argument surrounding Reagan's foreign policy into the, at the end of the Cold War is polarizing and often breaks along partisan lines within the United States. With conservatives and Republicans giving more credit to Reagan for following an effective and conscious foreign policy. Then initially, challenged the Soviet Union in its first term in order to apply pressure for change. And then, embracing that change in a second term. Critics of Reagan argue the opposite, that his foreign policy had no effect on the end of the Cold War and he was a lucky bystander to historical changes driven largely by Mikhail Gorbachev. In fact, ReaganÂ’s harshest critics argued that his confrontational strategy in his first term risked reigniting the Cold War in the early 1980s. So, did Reagan have a plan? It's difficult to say, but his behavior across his two, his two terms does at least suggest adaptation along the lines that his defenders endorse. First, confrontation to build up US strength and undermine Soviet advantages. Then negotiation with the Soviets when a reformist leader emerges. So Reagan definitely confronts the Soviet Union and applies pressure during his first term in a number of ways. First rhetorically, he sharpened American ideological attacks on the Soviet Union. Famously calling the soviet union an evil empire and predicting the demise of communism. I, I provide a few of his best quotes on this slide. But he also pursued concrete policies, such as a large arms build up and an antimissile defense system known as SDI or Star Wars, that threatened to undermine the balance of power in the realm of nuclear weapons. Finally, he pursued a policy that became known as the Reagan Doctrine of undermining Soviet backed regimes in developing countries around the world to reverse some of the gains that the Soviets had enjoyed in the third world. All of these policies added up to a renewal of Cold War competition and antagonism that initially resulted in more hostile relations- Between the United States and the Soviet Union during Reagan's first term. However, in his second term, Reagan changes course in response to reform and concessions coming out of the Soviet Union, under the new leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev. Reagan softens his rhetoric which I show in a few quotes demonstrating Reagan's embrace of Soviet reform. He also pursued concrete policy initiatives, particularly in arms control, in attempts to dramatically reduce the number of nuclear weapons each superpower possessed. Now, these negotiations were conducted on favorable terms for the United States, but Reagan was under pressure from many of his advisors not to engage or trust Gorbachev, and more importantly, he ignored those warnings. >> Okay. So let's, shift gears. >> Okay. >> And look at the other side of the coin here, the role of Mikhail Gorbachev and the Soviet Union, and ask the question was Mikhail Gorbachev the central first mover for the end of the Cold War? So, of course, many argue that the true source of the crucial changes that ended the Cold War came not from American side but from the Soviet side, and that the source of these changes was for the most part, the new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, who came to power in the Soviet Union in 1985. Now the logic for this position that Mikhail Gorbachev was the central figure in ending the Cold War is pretty straightforward. Foreign policy in the Soviet Union showed no real change until Gorbachev came to power despite the fact that confrontation from the United States under Ronald Reagan had existed for, four years under his first term. Only when Gorbachev came to power, did things begin to change. Essentially, those who advocate for a large role for Mikhail Gorbachev in ending the Cold War, argue that he is the one indispensable piece in the drama of the end of the Cold War. From this perspective, if you take away Gorbachev, take him out of the picture, then from their perspective, the Cold War does not end as it did. So what changes did Gorbachev enact, exactly? Now, he enacted a lot of changes, both domestically and in foreign policy. But I want to emphasize two of these changes. First, there was a significant change in foreign policy thinking and ideology. Since the beginning of the Cold War, Soviet leaders followed an ideology that expected hostility and confrontation between the Soviet Union and the West, based on ideological difference. Just what George Kennan foresaw, in his long telegram. This hostility that was a presumed by Soviet leaders, necessitated an aggressive stance toward the United States and a reluctance on that part of the Soviet Union to cooperate or negotiate about anything. And so, just as George Kennan laid a containment strategy that said expect hostility from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had a mirror image of the United States, to expect hostility from the United States and act accordingly. Now what was really a substantial change under Gorbachev was that he transformed this thinking, and intentionally and publicly called his foreign policy new thinking. He emphasized rather than the innate antagonism between the two sides of the Cold War. He emphasized the mutual and collective security of countries around the world. He talked about the advantages of universal values that united all countries rather than stressing ideology that divided the East and the West. He even argued for the benefits to the Soviet Union of cooperations and even concessions to improve the Soviet's image in the West to kind of force them, the West to come on board to this new way of thinking about security. It was these ideological changes that were crucial for legitimizing his more concessionary approach to foreign policy. So the first big change was this new thinking, this, this change in ideas. Now the best example, the second big change I want to emphasize, in concrete policy terms of his new thinking, I would say, was the Soviet Union's approach and its policies toward its traditional sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. Now in addition to the film on the Vietnam War you also have a very good film in my opinion from the CNN Cold War Series on the changing Soviet foreign policy toward Eastern Europe and the subsequent collapse of Soviet supported Communist regimes there that are wound up in this iconic fall of the Berlin Wall. The film does a very good job of capturing Gorbachev's decision making process through direct interviews with Gorbachev himself, and with other major politicians, like George H W Bush, from that time and place. So, the concrete change in Soviet relations with Eastern Europe was a move away from what was known as the Brezhnev Doctrine. And the Brezhnev Doctrine declared that the Soviet Union was committed to using military force if necessary to maintain Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. In the face of any, sort of popular pressure for a change. This intervention was not just a threat. It occurred numerous times before and after Brezhnev's rule. In Hungary in 1956, in the Prague Spring in 1968, indirectly in Poland, where the Soviets pressured the Poland and the Polish military to crack down on Solidarity that labor union that launched strikes in protest in 1980. In all of these cases, when changes looked like they were getting out of hand and might actually threaten Communist regimes, the Soviet Union used repression to end the popular demands for change. As you see in the film on the fall of the Berlin Wall, Gorbachev signaled a change in his policy that became known as the Sinatra Doctrine, which was, you guessed it. Named after Frank Sinatra >> And his song, My Way. I couldn't make this up. It was, it was named that by a Soviet Foreign minister, too. And, it was because East European countries were going to be allowed to do it their way. Now, this is an example of soft power. >> Right? So now, no longer would Communist systems be kept in power by the threat of the, of Soviet force. This was a game-changer, and there's this great scene in this film, On the Fall of the Berlin Wall. Where the leader of the Czech, Czechoslovakia says well you know, East Germany was pressuring Gorbachev to, to crack down and Gorbachev didn't say anything but he gave me this look that said, no we're not going to do that. >> So, so now the introduction of the Sinatra Doctrine had enormous consequences for the end of the Cold War. First. The removal of the threat to use force to proper Communist regimes embolden protesters and reformers. Within the regimes in Eastern Europe, to go further and faster in reforming and even dismantling Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. Those committed to change no longer have to fear that efforts to bring down communism. Would actually bring on greater repression and make things worse in the form of a Soviet military intervention. Second, the collapse of one Communist regime after another in Eastern Europe, in 1989 and 1990, contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union itself in 1991. The Soviet Union lost in the collapse of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and its sphere of influence there, a key source of its legitimacy among its own citizens. The, this empire was a point of pride for many Soviet citizens and the key sign that the Soviet Union was a superpower. Moreover, the collapse of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe provided hope and a road map, arguably, for reformers and protestors. Within the Soviet Union, to challenge their own Communist regime. What seemed impossible only months before, namely, the collapse of the Soviet Union itself, now seemed possible. If Poles and Hungarians, East Germans and Romanians could bring down their Communist regimes, why couldn't Russians and non-Russians within the Soviet Union do it as well? Now on a final note, we presented this sort of explanation for the Cold War between did Reagan do it or did Gorbachev do it, but there are other explanations that do not focus on individual leaders like Reagan and Gorbachev. For example, many argue from the role of, on the role of the United States, that the United States did indeed play a vital role in the end of the Cold War, but not primarily due to Reagan's foreign policy. Instead they argued that the cumulative effect of containment eventually wore down the Soviet system. In essence they claimed that Kennan won the Cold War. And Kennan was right that eventually the Soviet system was forced to reform because the United States effectively contained its expension, expansion and demonstrated that its political and economic system was superior. On the other side, others have pointed to mass actors within Communist states. Both in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union that pushed for change that far outstripped the goals of reformers like Gorbachev, who wanted to tinker with the system. Make it better but remain in power and keep the communist regime intact. Protest movements and their leaders press for dismantling the whole system. And eventually, accomplish the, these goals despite the plans of leaders who thought they could manage, change, and remain in power.
