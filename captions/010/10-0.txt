 This third module discusses the history of US foreign policy through the World Wars from 1919 to 1945. You might think about these segments as oriented around understanding why the peace of 1919 collapsed so quickly into war by 1939. The first segment begins with an overview of the Versailles Treaty. We discuss how Woodrow Wilson tried to construct a new world system centered on a new international organization called the League of Nations. Ultimately, his efforts failed because he effectively bypassed the interests of Congress in this ambitious plan to leave Americans' isolationist past behind. You might also think about this section as setting up the following question: How did the Treaty of Versailles and American's role in its construction contribute to the outbreak of World War II? The second segment looks at US foreign policy in the 1920s and that's whether it can be characterized by the grand strategy of isolationism. The third segment briefly identifies some of the primary elements of the Great Depression and discusses how American policy contributed to the catastrophic collapse of the global economy from 1929 to 1933. We also look at how the Great Depression created the conditions for World War II. The fourth segment builds up to the outbreak of world war by discussing FDR's attempts in the 1930's to prepare the US for war in the fight against Nazi totalitarianism even though the broader public was staunchly isolationist after the Great Depression. The fifth segment transitions from World War II to the Cold War and that's why wartime collaboration during World War II between the United States and the Soviet Union collapses so quickly into a global competition that would at one point leave these two states on the brink of nuclear annihilation.
