 Now let's talk about war. We're gonna spend the rest of the class today talking about it. And I wanna first begin with a simple definition. Political scientists think of war as a military contest among competing large organizations. This organizational component helps to distinguish war from criminal activity which is perpetuated by inguals -- individuals or small groups of people. In a war, these organizations possess some underlying conflict of interest over some issue, so there's political disagreement between the contending groups. Prior to the outbreak of war they are unable to reach some type of a compromise that could have alleviated the need for both sides to pay the costs associated with going to war. A war entails the use of physical punishment to try and secure a new round of concessions over the issue in dispute from the adversary. In other words, by using the power to hurt, one side tries to get the other to give in. And so think again about the schoolyard bully. He walks up to a little kid demanding $1 lunch money. That demand is probably coupled by, with a threat. If the target fails to give in to the threat of extortion, the bully then pops the little kid in the nose. Perhaps then, the little kid pays the $1. That bully has just fought a limited war to extract some tribute, to get a better deal from that little kid. War can also be fought for another reason, the disarmament of an adversary. In this case, one side seeks to destroy the capacity of the other organization to fight back now or in the future. Total military victory then creates the opportunity to impose a settlement on the loser to remake the political system of the loser. You can think about World War II in these terms. The allies wanted to impose severe military costs on Germany to reduce its capacity to fight back in the future. The allies could then construct a new political order in Europe, one that would effectively eliminate the Nazis as a viable political force. You should take away one more point from this discussion, though. The act of war is a political act A famous military strategist, Clausewitz, defined war as "the continuation" "of politics by other means." This means that violence is instrumental. It's a mean to some larger political end. >> Okay. So we're going to change topics a bit here and discuss the ethics of war, and start with a paradox, right. Given the destructiveness of war as, as Pat just defined, war is, is a military conflict between large organizations, and that's, it implies massive destruction, right. Given this level of destructiveness of war, can it ever be justified on moral grounds? If so, under what conditions can there be what philosophers and others have called a "just war." Now Pat offered some ideas on this issue already in his discussion about the dilemma facing the use of power by a state in the domestic realm and in the international realm. We seem to face this paradox as we've already discussed in this regard. We need legitimate authorities to wield force, to maintain order and security so that individuals or, or individual actors don't have to achieve this security on their own and arm themselves, right? Indeed, we often expect such authorities to have a monopoly on force. Only the police, arguably, should have the guns so that they can enforce laws and individuals do not need to take the law into their own hands. But the dilemma rests in controlling those with the guns, right? This is a problem within the domestic realm. But it is arguably an even bigger problem in the international realm, because there is no overarching world government. That can easily enforce rules on sovereign states. The United State, the United Nations exists as an international organization but it doesn't have the monopoly on force to enforce any rules that are adopted by that organization on large and powerful states like the United States or Russia. And so, States have historically engaged in war. It is a reality, arguably, of the international system. So States engage in war, they have historically done so, we are, they are doing so now, they will probably do so in the future. But should they, is wherever ethically justifiable? If so, under what conditions is war morally defensible? This is an important question for a number of reasons. Even though war may be an unavoidable fact of international relations, States have made an effort to control the initiation and conduct of war, and place parameters on military conflict to mitigate the worst excesses of war. States, particularly in the United States, have also defended wars on moral grounds. Americans, in particular, it seems have felt a need to provide moral justifications for the use of military force. We want to see ourselves as the good guys, arguably. From an ethical perspective, war causes great harm. It involves mass killings, thousands, even millions die in war. Whole cities and cultural sites are destroyed. What could possibly justify this level of harm from an ethical point of view? That's the question. So when thinking about this problem of war, then, I want to distinguish between three different perspectives. Realism, idealism, and pacifism. Realism suggests that international relations is different from domestic politics. There is no overarching world authority. States basically exist in an anarchic world order and that's, they must provide their own security through their own military power. The international realm resembles in Hobbes's words, the state of nature, all right. In such an environment, realists argue morality should take a decidedly secondary role in decision making, and cannot be applied to issues of war. As such, realists argue that war is not, and should not be, subject to moral constraints. Strategic considerations, not moral ones, must dictate international relations, including war, right? So, from one perspective, the realist perspective, there is no reason to debate a war as just or unjust. Idealism, on the other hand, places moral considerations at the center of international relations. Idealists argue that values matter, and they want to pursue foreign policies that match key national values, such as democracy promotion, or prom, protection of human rights. However, idealists are not necessarily pacifists, which we'll talk about in a second, as can be seen by the history of the US foreign policy. Woodrow Wilson, who was the epitome of an idealist foreign policy decision maker took us into World War I. President Barack Obama arguably, arguably a liberal internationalist, has proposed using military force to combat the threat of ISIS and and other potential threats. So, US foreign policy during the Cold War, was cast as a fight between good and evil in its strategy of containment of communism. So in fact, idealism can and does see morally defensible uses for military force and war. And so idealists want to use value to make decisions about foreign policy and about war but that doesn't mean then that they automatically dismiss war as never morally justified. In fact there are under certain con conditions for a idealist, a morally justified war or a just war. It's only pacifists that deny that there can be any justifiable reasons to go to war. For the pacifist, the mass killing and maiming of a war can never be justified. It is always wrong. There's no goal that is worth the destruction of war, so as the song from the playlist this morning goes, war, what is it good for? He never follows through. Absolutely nothing. >> Say it again. >> Oh jeez. Say it with some feeling, man. >> So, okay, you failed once again. >> I just wanted to hear you sing. >> Sing. Get all excited. >> And get all it excited. >> You're, still acting out the bully role here. I can tell. So, just war theory, now I wanna discuss just war theory which is squarely within the idealist approach to foreign policy because it will, it wants to find moral justification for certain wars. So it's situated between realism's de-emphasis, moral considerations and international rel, relations, and war. And pacifismÂ’s rejection of any moral justification for the harm caused by war. In between those two polar opposite, position is an idealist approach that would include this just war theory. Now just war theory has a very long history in western political thought on war. It dates back as far as the 5th century on St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century. In the 20th century, the Catholic Church, as well as secular thinkers like Michael Walzer, reiterated the main tenets of just war theory in light of nuclear weapons and American involvement in the Vietnam War. As your reading for today by Crawford shows, since 9/11, just war theory has, again resurfaced, and has been questioned, and challenged, as war has kind of transformed in the face of terrorism and non-state actors' threats. So, we'll talk more about that in next lecture. Just war theory argues that war can be morally justified. If, and this is the crucial caveat, if certain requirements are met, and so, just war theory doesn't mean, doesn't argue that all war, or any war is necessarily just, but that war can be just if certain conditions are met. A just war has three major components. A just initiation, or in Latin jus ad bellum, a just conduct, jus in bello. And just aftermath, jus post bellum, right? So, just resort to war, the initiation, just conduct of war, and just aftermath of war. Right, three arenas. So let's break these out, right. Just initiation or just resort to war. This is the most developed part of the just war tradition. Initiation of war from the just war tradition has six requirements. First and foremost, the first requirement is that a just war must have a just cause. The most commonly cited just cause. For the initiation of war is self-defense. If another state has attacked you, or is about to attack you, then a state has the right to defend itself through war. And so, the classic example of this is the attack of, on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, and America's response of entering World War II as a reaction to this attack, right? And so, if you're engaged in self-defense after an attack, you have a just initiation of war. Secondly, a just war is, is just only if armed conflict is taken as a last resort, and all other means to find some sort of less violent resolution of a conflict have been exhausted. And so, all forms of diplomacy must have been tried before using armed force from this tradition. Thirdly, a just war can only be undertaken by a legitimate authority. In most cases, this refers to a state, a government in control of territory, right? This is intended, this provision of the just war theory is intended to provide some centralized control over the decision to go to war. Limiting the initiation of war to states avoids the potential chaos of private actors with private armies using mass violence to pursue their goals. And so a just war is conducted by states. Fourth, a just war requires the right intention. This is correlated, if you will, to the first idea of a just cause, right? War most be motivated, for example, by defense rather by, rather than by aggression or revenge or acquisition of territory or some other material gain. The, of course the trick here is judging the eh, true intentions of states. Right? Fifth, a just war has a reasonable chance of success. Given the degree of violence and death that is associated with war, states must not, from this tradition, engage in suicide missions. If there is little or no chance of victory, then, even if there are right intentions, and an original cause that is just, such as self-defense, a war may not be just, because it isn't winnable. And finally, there is the issue of proportionality, which is central to the next stage, that we'll talk about in a second just conduct of war. The anticipated benefits of engaging in war, what's gonna happen afterward, must be proportional to the anticipated harm that will be caused by that war. And so if you're only going to get one little sliver of land or, or protect a very small amount of people but you're going to kill many a people in a war to do that, then, that war lacks proportionality. Now, of course who decides whether these requirements have been met, is contentious. Think of past example of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. Some European allies questioned whether military invention was a last resort, there. And some even questioned whether the United States had the right intention. Was more debated by defense rather by, than by some aggression or even some material gain in the form of, of securing access to oil or, or some other key resource. Now, the next part of the just work can tradition is just war, just conduct in war. A just war also requires just conduct. This entails two basic principles. First is discrimination. States should not target civilians because they are not, because they are not combatants and thus, are not party to the conflict. This is discrimination. It needs to discriminate between combatants and non-combatants. The violence of war should be limited to violence committed by soldiers against other soldiers. Violence inflicted on non-combatants, especially when committed intentionally and consciously, is not legitimate, according to this tradition during war. In other words, if a war is otherwise just with a just cause of self-defense, soldiers killing other soldiers may be morally acceptable. But even if a war has a just cause, violence against civilians is not acceptable. That, then, is murder rather than casualties in war. Second, there is the principal of proportionality, which I alluded to in, just earlier. How much force is morally acceptable in a war? Is anything that weakens the enemy, or can aid one's victory acceptable? Or are there certain actions that are off limits even in war time? The classic saying "all's fair in love and war" comes into question from this tradition. Most societies have agreed there are atrocities that should be avoided even in war time. According to just war theory, the amount of force used during a war should be proportional to the ends of the war. Unnecessary violence should be avoided. There are atrocities and war crimes that are off limits from this tradition. Prisoners of war should not be harmed, women should not be raped, children should not be killed. War should not be so destructive as to destroy society and the state itself. That is why nuclear weapons, which we'll discuss separately in an upcoming lecture, were such a challenge for just war theory. Given the destructive capacity of nuclear weapons to destroy all of human civilization arguably, could any nuclear, any use of nuclear war be proportional to any set of goals? The final part of the just war tradition is just conduct after war. A just war produces an acceptable aftermath for the defeated parties. The victors should not be free have free reign to do whatever they want with the defeated. And this has two principles. All right? There's principles of discrimination and proportionality, just like just conduct in war. The ultimate goal of a just war is to reestablish peace. And that peace must be preferable to the peace that existed before the war. Punishments should be proportional, and should not be overly severe. So those are the three parts of the just war condition. Now one of the problems in sorting out the ethics of war is establishing individual moral responsibility. Who is morally responsible for actions during war time? Is it states as the legal authorities that initiate wars? Or is it individuals, for example, soldiers who actually conduct the violence of war. Do soldiers act ethically as long as they follow rules of engagement during war time. That is, provide a just conduct of war even if they are on the side of a war that might have been in, initiated for unjust reasons, right? And so if the war is unjust, who is responsible? Is it only the leaders of the state that initiated an unjust war moralry, morally responsible? And finally, what about the moral responsibility of citizens who may have supported those leaders? Are citizens, particularly in a democracy, who collectively have greater influence over their leaders, more morally responsible for wars initiated by those leaders than citizens in authoritarian regimes that have less impact on them. And so the final point that I'd want to make. Is that, the requirements of just war theory that I just went through, and they seem high. There's a litany of things that must be followed and, and usually you can't find any war that hits every single one of them. But, the broader argument about war from the just war theory, follows much of the arguments and logic that we've already covered. And that is that, war sometime may be a necessary evil, if you will, because it avoids a greater harm of not acting with military force to stop some predator. And so, yeah, and there's a quote on your slide from the Crawford reading that we'll cover in more detail later. And that is, as bad as war is it may be necessary to avoid a greater harm of not engaging in war. Think Adolf Hitler in the control of Europe by a a Germany that was controlled by the Nazi party. And so there is this argument of a utilitarian approach. If you go back to your frameworks from earlier in the semester. Utilitarianism argues that an ethical action either, produces the most benefit for the largest group of people, or avoids the most harm for the largest group of people. And arguably a war, despite the destruction that it might create could, in its aftermath, avoid the greatest harm for the most amount of people. And this is where questions about Nazi Germany or even the current crisis in IS, of ISIS in the Middle East, in Iraq and Syria might come into play.
