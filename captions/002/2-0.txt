 ï»¿1 Welcome back. In this module, we will be introducing the role of ethics in US foreign policy. This course has the Ethics and Leadership flag, and, therefore, we will be discussing the practical ethics of US foreign policy throughout the course. For this module, we will discuss some of the basic concepts and ethical frameworks that will be used to analyze foreign policy decisions throughout the semester. This module contains three lecture segments. The first segment introduces ethical reasoning and outlines five different ethical frameworks that we will be using throughout the course. In the second segment, we will discuss ethical dilemmas and how values can come into conflict with one another, forcing decision makers to make a choice between two or more values that they deem to both be attractive. Finally, in the third segment, we have an interview with Professor William Inboden from the LBJ School of Public Policy. Professor Inboden is an expert on ethics in US foreign policy, and he tells us about his experiences serving in government and how politicians and their advisors grapple with practical ethics when making foreign policy.
